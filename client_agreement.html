                for the sudden and unusual price movement.

    <p>Order is an instruction provided by the Client to the Company, indicating to either open or close a position when the market price reaches a specified level.</p>
    <p>Order Level is the price specified in the Order, which, when reached, triggers the execution of the order.</p>
    <p>Parties refer to the parties involved in this Agreement, namely, the Company and the Client.</p>
    <p>
        Pip Hunting refers to a situation in which the Client opens a position and quickly closes it within a very short time, often when there is only a profit of one pip. This practice is characterized by rapid
        trading for small profit margins.
    </p>
    <p>Price Gap can be one of the following scenarios:</p>
    <p>* The current Quote Bid is higher than the Ask price of the previous Quote.</p>

    <p>Professional Client is a client who qualifies as a "Professional Client" under the regulations and guidelines that apply to their trading activities.</p>

        Scalping is a trading strategy where the Client opens multiple positions simultaneously and quickly closes them, often within less than five minutes. This strategy may involve buying at the Bid price and selling
        at the Ask price to profit from the Bid/Ask spread.
    </p>
    <p>
        Server refers to the MetaTrader program version 5 or a later version, along with any trading platforms, including web and mobile versions. This program is used to execute the Client's Orders, Instructions, or

    <p>
        Short Position represents a sell position that increases in value when market prices decline. In the context of Currency Pairs, it involves selling the Base Currency against the Quote Currency. It is essentially
        the opposite of a Long Position.
    </p>
    <p>
        Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed. Slippage often occurs during periods of higher market volatility, making it
        challenging to execute an order at a specific price. This is particularly relevant when market orders are used or when large orders are executed, and there isn't enough market interest at the desired price level to maintain the
        expected trade price.
    </p>
    <p>
        Spread is the difference between the Ask price and the Bid price of an Underlying Asset in a CFD at the same moment. It represents the cost or the profit that traders encounter when entering or exiting a trade.

    <p>Swap or Rollover pertains to the interest amount added to or deducted from holding a position open overnight. This interest adjustment is often associated with financing costs or benefits.</p>
    <p>
        Trailing Stop is a stop-loss order set at a percentage level below the market price for a long position. The trailing stop price automatically adjusts as the market price fluctuates. For a sell trailing stop
        order, the stop price remains fixed below the market price, and it is adjusted upwards as the market price rises. However, if the market price falls, the stop loss price does not change, and a market order is executed when the
        stop price is reached.
    </p>
    <p>Transaction refers to any contract or trade involving a Contract for Difference (CFD) that is executed by the Client or on behalf of the Client under the terms of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>Transaction Size is calculated by multiplying the Lot Size by the number of Lots involved in the CFD.</p>
    <p>Underlying Asset is the financial instrument on which a CFD is based. It could be a Currency (Foreign Exchange), Equity Indices, Metal, Futures, Commodities, or Shares.</p>

    <p>* Words in the singular form also include the plural form, and vice versa.</p>
    <p>* Gender-specific terms such as masculine or feminine should be understood to include the opposite gender as well.</p>
    <p>* References to "persons" include corporations, partnerships, other unincorporated entities, and all other legal entities, and vice versa.</p>
    <p>* Clause headings are provided for ease of reference.</p>
    <p>
        * Any reference to an act, regulation, or law includes that act, regulation, or law as modified, supplemented, consolidated, or re-enacted from time to time. It also encompasses any associated guidance, directives, statutory
        instruments, orders, and any statutory provision that re-enacts the referred statutory provision.

        </p><h5>3. Commencement And Account Activation</h5>
    <p></p>
    <p>
         Binding Nature of the Agreement: This Agreement is legally binding and applies to the Company, its successors, and assigns, as well as the Client's heirs, executors, administrators, legatees, successors, and
        personal representatives. It ensures that the obligations and terms of the Agreement extend to relevant parties and their successors or representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
         Effective Date and Account Activation: The Agreement becomes effective when the Company sends a notice to the Client confirming the opening of the Client's Account and when the Client makes the first funding
        of the Account. In essence, the Agreement takes effect when the Client's account is officially established and funded.
    </p>
    <p>
         Minimum Initial Deposit: Depending on the Client's account type, there is a requirement for a minimum initial deposit. The Client is not allowed to commence trading if the initial deposit falls below this
        minimum. However, the Company has the discretionary right (but not the obligation) to change the Client's account type, enabling the Client to start trading even if the initial deposit is less than the minimum. This allows for
        flexibility in account management.
    </p>
    <p>
         Client Acceptance: The Company is not legally obligated and, due to applicable regulations, may be unable to accept the Client as a customer until specific documentation, properly and filled out by the Client,
        is received. In addition, the Company must complete all internal checks. This clause ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and internal procedures before accepting the Client.
    </p>
    <p>
        </p><h5>4. Client Categorization</h5>
    <p></p>
    <p>
         Client Categorization Levels: The Client acknowledges that different categories of Clients (Retail Clients, Professional Clients, and Eligible Counterparties) receive varying levels of regulatory protection.
        Retail Clients are granted the highest level of protection, while Professional Clients and Eligible Counterparties are assumed to possess more experience, knowledge, and risk assessment capabilities, thus receiving a lower level
        of protection.
    </p>
    <p>
         Categorization Method: The Company will classify the Client as a Retail Client, Professional Client, or Eligible Counterparty based on how the Client completes the Application Form and under the method of
        categorization as explained in the section titled "Client Categorization." By accepting this Agreement, the Client consents to the application of this categorization method.
    </p>
    <p>
         Accuracy of Information: The Client acknowledges that the Company will rely on the accuracy, completeness, and correctness of the information provided by the Client in the Application Form when categorizing
        and interacting with the Client. The Client holds the responsibility to promptly inform the Company in writing if there are any changes to this information.
    </p>
    <p>
         Review and Potential Recategorization: Subject to applicable regulations, the Company retains the right to review the Client's categorization and make changes to the Client's categorization if it deems it
        necessary (following applicable laws).
    </p>
    <p>
        </p><h5>5. Capacity</h5>
    <p></p>
    <p>
         Client's Capacity: The Client acts as a principal and not as an agent, representative, trustee, or custodian on behalf of another party. This means that all obligations and responsibilities outlined in this
        Agreement are solely directed towards the Client, and the Client must fulfil these obligations concerning the Company.
    </p>
    <p>
         Client Acting on Behalf of Another: The Client may represent or act on behalf of someone else only with the explicit written consent of the Company. To do so, the Client must provide all the necessary
        documents as required by the Company for this specific purpose. This clause emphasizes that representing others requires formal approval and documentation.
    </p>
    <p> Company's Role in Transactions: In the context of any Transaction, the Company may function in two different capacities:</p>
    <p>i) As a principal on its account, where it acts as the execution venue for the Transaction.</p>
    <p>ii) As an agent, in which case another third party serves as the execution venue for the Transaction.</p>
    <p>
        </p><h5>6. Third Party</h5>
    <p></p>
    <p>
         Client's Right to Authorize Third Parties: The Client has the right to authorize a third party to provide Instructions, Requests, and Orders to the Company regarding any Transaction, proposed Transaction, or
        other matters related to this Agreement. This authorization may also include the ability to vary the terms of the Agreement or terminate it. However, this right is subject to the condition that the Client must inform the Company
        in writing about the exercise of this right.
    </p>
    <p>
         Company's Right to Seek Specifications: The Company is granted the right, although not obligated, to request specific details or specifications regarding third-party authorization. This allows the Company to
        better understand and process the authorization.
    </p>
    <p>
         Additional Authorizations: The authorization granted to a third party is in addition to any other authorizations already specified in this Agreement or any other agreement between the Client and the Company.
    </p>
    <p>
         Continuation of Authorization: Unless the Company receives and acknowledges a written notification from the Client indicating the termination, revocation, or amendment of the instructions given to the third
        party, through courier service or via email, the Company will continue to accept Requests, Instructions, Orders, and other communications from the authorized third party. The Client agrees that such communications are valid and
        binding.
    </p>
    <p>
         Notice Period for Termination: To terminate the authorization to a third party, as established in clause 6.1, the written notification for termination must be received and acknowledged by the Company with at
        least a 5-day notice before the specified termination date.
    </p>
    <p>
         Responsibility in Case of Client's Death or Mental Incapacity: In the unfortunate event of the Client's death or mental incapacity, the Company holds no responsibility or liability regarding the actions,
        omissions, or potential fraud of the authorized third party mentioned in clause 6.1. The Company will continue to accept and recognize Requests, Instructions, Orders, and other communications from this third party as valid until
        the Company receives actual notice of the Client's death or mental incapacity. This clause underscores the importance of timely notification in such circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
         Effect on Client's Obligations: Any revocation or amendment of the third-party authorization does not relieve the Client from any obligations or liabilities arising from or concerning Transactions or their
        accounts under the Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        </p><h5>7. Personal Data &amp; Confidentiality</h5>
    <p></p>
    <p>7.1 </p>
    <p>
         The Company recognizes that the Client's personal information is a valuable, unique asset that is the exclusive property of the Client. The Company is obligated not to use this information to benefit or
        further the interests of any individuals or entities other than the Client. This provision underscores the Company's responsibility to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of the Client's data and not to exploit it for any
        other purposes.
    </p>
    <p>7.2 </p>
    <p>
         Protection of Client Information: The Company is committed to safeguarding the Client's rights concerning the privacy, confidentiality, and anonymity of the information provided to the Company. All data shared
        will be processed fairly and legally for specified and legitimate purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
         Communication and Use of Information: The Company and its affiliates may use the Client's information to inform them about other products, services, and offers, including those from third parties. Various
        communication methods, such as postal mail, facsimile, and electronic means, may be used for this purpose.

    <p> Market Volatility:
        The prices displayed on our trading platforms are sourced directly from our LPs and represent valid market prices at the time of display. However, due to the dynamic nature of the forex market, these prices may some time highly differ from those offered by other brokers or general market data providers. This variance can occur due to differences in liquidity, market conditions, and the specific LP feeds utilized.</p>
    <p>Spread Widening:
    During times of market volatility or reduced liquidity, spreads (the difference between the bid and ask prices) may widen. This widening can happen swiftly and is a normal occurrence in forex trading.

        incorporated by reference into this Agreement. This means that the rules and procedures of the Saint Lucia International Arbitration Centre will apply to the arbitration process.
    </p>
    <p> Arbitration Venue and Jurisdiction:</p>
    <p>. Both Parties agree to the following regarding arbitration:</p>
    <p>. The Saint Lucia International Arbitration Centre has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the arbitration proceedings.</p>
    <p>. They submit to the jurisdiction of the Saint Lucia International Arbitration Centre.</p>
    <p>. They waive any objection to the arbitration proceedings taking place in any other venue and agree not to claim that the chosen arbitration centre does not have jurisdiction.</p>
    <p> Arbitration Details:</p>
    <p>. The number of arbitrators will be determined.</p>
    <p>. The seat or legal place of arbitration will be specified.</p>
    <p>. The language in which the arbitration will be conducted will be determined.</p>
    <p> Waiver of Jurisdictional Challenges:</p>
    <p>Both Parties irrevocably waive any jurisdictional challenges to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This means they will not raise objections related to jurisdiction during the arbitration proceedings.</p>
    <p> The doctrine of Separability:</p>
    <p>The doctrine of separability applies to paragraph 3. This doctrine means that the validity of the arbitration agreement is considered separately from the overall validity of the Agreement.</p>
    <p> Time Limit for Bringing Actions:</p>
    <p>The Client is bound by a time limit for bringing actions related to transactions under the Agreement. The Client must initiate any such action within three months from the day the cause of action arose.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p> Severability Clause:</p>
    <p>
        If any part of the Agreement is found to be unenforceable, illegal, or in violation of any market rule, regulation, or law of any regulatory authority, a court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to make this
        determination.
    </p>
    <p> Consequences of Severability:</p>
    <p>If any part of the Agreement is deemed unenforceable or in violation, that specific part will be considered as if it had never been included in the Agreement.</p>
    <p> Effect on the Remaining Provisions:</p>
    <p>The remaining provisions of the Agreement will continue to be legally valid and enforceable, and they will be interpreted and enforced as if the problematic provision had never been part of the Agreement.</p>
    <p> Jurisdiction-Specific Considerations:</p>
    <p>
        The provision also highlights that the legality, validity, or enforceability of the Agreement, or the specific provision in question, may be assessed according to the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions, and any such
        assessments will not affect the rest of the Agreement.

    </p>
    <p>
         Limitation of Liability: The company, its directors, officers, employees, and other parties involved in providing online services shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, or consequential damages

         No Investment Advice: The client acknowledges that the company does not provide investment advice. Market information provided by the company does not constitute advice of any kind, and the client uses such
        information at their own risk.
    </p>
    <p> Client's Sole Responsibility: All transactions and market fluctuations in the client's account are at the client's sole risk, and the client is solely liable under all circumstances.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
         Reasonable Determination of Manifest Error: The company will act reasonably in deciding whether an error qualifies as a Manifest Error. The determination may take into account factors such as the state of the
        underlying market at the time of the error or the clarity of information sources or pronouncements used to set quoted prices.
    </p>
    <p>
         No Liability for Manifest Errors: Unless there is evidence of the company's fraud, willful default, or negligence, the company will not be liable for any losses, costs, claims, demands, or expenses arising
        from a Manifest Error, including errors made by information sources or commentators relied upon by the company.
    </p>
    <p>
         Return of Monies: If a Manifest Error occurs, and the company exercises its rights under the agreement terms, and if the client has received any funds from the company in connection with the Manifest Error,
        the client agrees to promptly return an equal sum to the company.
    </p>
    <p>
        </p><h5>43. Amendment</h5>
    <p></p>
    <p>
         Client Acceptance of Amendments: The client acknowledges and agrees to be bound by any amendments or variations to the agreement that are made following the provisions of the agreement. The client further
        agrees that their first transaction initiated following a change to the agreement's terms will constitute their acceptance of the change. The execution of such a transaction by the company is considered a good consideration for
        the amendment.
    </p>
    <p>
         Notice of Amendments: The company has the right to amend the terms of the agreement at any time, but it must provide the client with at least two business days of written notice before such changes become
        effective. However, it's noted that variations made to reflect changes in laws or regulations may take effect immediately.
