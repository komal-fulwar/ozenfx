                          <h3>KYC / AML Policies</h3>
                          <p>Ozenfx Markets Ltd. is committed to the highest standards of compliance against money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorist financing (CTF). The objective of the Companies Policy against Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing is to actively prevent the risks of these matters. To help the government combat the financing of terrorism and money laundering activities, the law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. We have an obligation to report suspicious client activity relevant to money laundering.</p>
                      
                          <h5>Money Laundering</h5>
                          <p>The process of converting funds received from illegal activities (such as fraud, corruption, terrorism, etc.) into other funds or investments that appear legitimate to hide or distort the actual source of funds.</p>
                      
                          <h5>The Money Laundering Process</h5>
                          <h5>Placement</h5>
                          <p>At this stage, the funds are turned into financial instruments, such as checks, bank accounts, and money transfers, or they can be used to buy high-value goods that can be resold. They can also be physically deposited in banks and non-bank institutions (e.g., exchange houses). To avoid suspicion on the part of the company, the bleach can also make several deposits instead of depositing the entire sum at once; this form of placement is called smurf.</p>
                          
                          <h5>Layers</h5>
                          <p>The funds are transferred or moved to other accounts and other financial instruments.
